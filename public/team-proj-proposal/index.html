                    <h3>Introduction and Information Problem</h3>
                    <p>
                        At the University of Maryland, there are a very large number of classes and professors. 
                        This is difficult for students because they have a hard time deciding which classes to take. 
                        This also is difficult for university management because they have a hard time looking at 
                        all of the information for each class. 
                        To summarize, the information problem we are aiming to solve is the lack of access to information about 
                        classes and professors. We are hoping to use the PlanetTerp grade data API to alleviate this issue. 
                        We will implement a search feature to search for classes or professors. 
                        You will be able to search up a professor and see which is their easiest/hardest class. 
                        Likewise, you can search up a class and find out which professors that teach it are the easiest/hardest. 
                        Lastly, we hope to implement two complete lists, one for classes and one for professors, 
                        that averages all the grades and tells you which classes/professors are the easiest and which are the hardest. 
                        All of these measures will be calculated using grade data. 
                        We hope that in the end, our service will benefit students that are looking for classes to take 
                        and faculty that want easier access to information about university classes.

                    <h3>Presentation Proposal</h3>
                    <p>
                        Students, faculty, and new incoming students utilize so many different devices. 
                        Although we can’t accommodate every single device and operating system possessed by every single student, 
                        we can accommodate the majority. Most students have laptops, desktop, and phone devices. 
                        As a result, we strive to make this platform compatible with these devices. 
                        In addition, iOS and Windows are one of the most used operating systems. 
                        Also, Android and Apple phones are also the most commonly used. 
                        If students do not have devices that support iOS and Windows, 
                        they always have access to Apple and Windows desktops and laptops on each of the campus libraries. 
                        Because of this, we are aiming to have the platform available for both iOS and Android phone users. 
                        It wouldn’t be fair to solely have it available for only a portion of students or faculty who are 
                        affiliated with the university or are newcomers.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <p><b>To cover the majority of devices we will support the following sizes:</b></p>
                        <li>Design for desktop displays from 1024×768 through 1920×1080</li>
                        <li>Design for mobile displays from 360×640 through 414×896</li>
                        <li>Design for tablet displays from 601×962 through 1280×800</li>
                        <li>Check Google Analytics and optimize for your target audience’s most common resolution sizes</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Data Handling</h3>
                    <p>
                        Currently, we are planning on storing our own data, 
                        but depending on the size requirement of the data and 
                        the performance target of our application, 
                        we might consider UMD servers (if available) or AWS to host our data.
                    </p>

                    <h3>App access, Security, and Privacy Consideration</h3>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <h5>Only use the permissions necessary for our app to work.</h5>
                                <p>
                                    Depending on how we are using the permissions, 
                                    there may be another way to do what we need (system intents, identifiers, backgrounding for phone calls) 
                                    without relying on access to sensitive information.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h5>Pay attention to permissions required by libraries.</h5>
                                <p>
                                    When we include a library, we also inherit its permission requirements.
                                    We should be aware of what libraries we are including, the licenses they require, 
                                    and what those permissions are used for.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h5>Be transparent.</h5>
                                <p>
                                    When we make a permissions request, we will be clear about what we are accessing and why, 
                                    so users can make informed decisions. 
                                    We will make this information available alongside the permission request, including install, 
                                    runtime, or update permission dialogues.
                                </p>
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <h5>Make the system accesses explicit.</h5>
                                <p>
                                    Providing continuous indications when we access sensitive capabilities 
                                    (for example, the camera or microphone) makes it clear to users when 
                                    we collect data and avoids the perception that we are collecting data surreptitiously.
                                </p>
                            </li>
